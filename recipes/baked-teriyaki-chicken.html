        <h2>Steps to make Baked Teriyaki Chicken</h2>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. </li>
        <li>Combine sugar, soy sauce, cider vinegar, cornstarch, cold water, garlic, ginger, and pepper in a small saucepan over low heat. Simmer, stirring frequently, until teriyaki sauce thickens and bubbles, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat. </li>
        <li>Place chicken thighs in the prepared baking dish. Brush both sides of each thigh with the sauce. Reserve any extra sauce for basting. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. </li>
        <li>Flip chicken and brush with sauce. Continue to bake, basting with remaining sauce every 10 minutes, until no longer pink and juices run clear, 20 to 30 more minutes. </li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy! </li>
